If you are completely new to sbt check older talks by [mr. Josh Suereth on youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=josh+suereth+sbt)

From last years [ScalaDays](http://www.scaladays.org/2013) the [Effective sbt](http://parleys.com/play/51c3790ae4b0d38b54f46259/chapter0/about) talk was great.
